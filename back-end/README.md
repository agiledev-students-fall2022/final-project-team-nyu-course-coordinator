# Back-end Directory Setup

This project was created with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Setting up an Express.js Back-end

- First, make sure you are in the correct back-end folder and then run `npm init`. This will generate the NPM project and its appropriate `package.json`.

```
cd back-end # the directory which houses the web server code
npm init # enter `server.js` as the entry point, when asked.
```

- Next you can install Express and save it to the list of dependencies outlined in the project's `package.json` file.

```
npm install express --save
```

## Running the app in the project directory
- First, install any dependencies using:
`npm install`

- Next, run the app on the localhost:3000:
`npm start`
