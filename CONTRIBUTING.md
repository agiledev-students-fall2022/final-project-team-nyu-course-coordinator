# Team Norms
In order to create a cohesive work environment, it is important that team members follow the guidelines outlined below. 
## Team Values
- All team member communications will be through Discord. Regular updates on team progress should be relayed here.
- Messages on Discord should be promptly responded within 24 hours by a team member.
- Team members are responsible for the tasks given to them and should complete them on time.
- Team members should collaborate on ideas and always be open to new solutions.
- Team members should follow general rules of respect, kindness, and tolerance towards their fellow members.

###### How to get help
- Team members should relay difficulties in a particular task through Discord. In this way, the team can collaborate on resolving the issue.
- If a team member cannot finish a task on time, he/she should communicate this with the rest of the team.
- If a particular task is deemed too difficult for the team to handle, it can either be scrapped for a different task or the team can consult with the course tutor/professor.
- Always ask for help. It is never the responsibility of a team member to have all the answers. We grow and learn from each other.

###### Resolving Conflicts
Understandably, disagreement is part of the collaboration process. As a result, it is important to keep these things in mind.
- Always respect a fellow team member's point of view.
- Any conflicts that the team is facing should be communicated on Discord.
- Compromise is key. All team members should actively try to work out solutions that benefit the whole team.
- Team members who consistently fail to meet deadlines and are actively inhibiting the project should be reported immediately to management.

## Sprint Cadence
- A usual sprint will take 2 weeks to complete.
- Team values should be upheld during each sprint.
- Sprints will begin by a day of Sprint Planning followed by Daily Standup.
- It is the product owner's duty to periodically check the product backlog and make any necessary changes.
- It is the scrummaster's duty that members are following the scrum framework. 

## Daily Standup
- Standup meetings will last from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the timeline.
- Meetings will be held in-person or on zoom synchronously and details will be communicated through Discord.
- All team members are required to attend. If a team member is unaivalable or cannot attend, he/she should let the team know beforehand. 
- The meeting will follow this guideline:
    - What have you worked on since the last meeting?
    - What are you working on right now?
    - What obstacles are blocking your progress?

###### Schedule (Tentative)
These are the following dates for daily standup as displayed on the course schedule. The timings for each of these meetings will be finalized through discord. These are subject to change:
- 10/4
- 10/13
- 10/20
- 11/1
- 11/3
- 11/8
- 11/15
- 11/17
- 11/22

## Coding Standards
- Code Editor: Phil Wee
- Code Linter: Laura Lourenco
- Write the minimum code to get things working. Code should be reviewed by fellow team members before merging into the `master` branch. 
- Before `commit` and `push`, always `pull` from the repository.
- Always push working code. If you break the pipeline/build, then fix it.
- Make small commits per task or feature.
- Commit messages should be descriptive.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Always delete dead/commented code.

## Git Workflow
The team follows a Feature Branch Workflow. Here is more information on it: [FBW](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

## Concluding Thoughts
Let's have a great project!
