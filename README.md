# Welcome to NYU Course Coordinator!
## About the Project
For NYU students, class registration can be a daunting task. From choosing classes, picking timeslots, and organizing a functioning schedule, there is a lot than can go wrong. And through NYU's built-in system, [NYU Albert](http://albert.nyu.edu/albert_index.html), the registration process can be confusing, inefficient, and nonsensical. 

This project aims to alleviate this burden by making the class registration process simple and easy. Students will be able to choose classes and fit them directly into a weekly calendar that is displayed showing time slots and course titles. Students can also input classes that they have already taken for their major which will be filtered out during course selection. As a result, students can focus on simply adding and deleting courses.

The program will offer:
 - a simplified user interface
 - a weekly calendar
 - Classes (course title, timings, and course description)

## Project History
This project was founded by Yuri Hwang, who sought to coordinate classes for NYU students in a simpler fashion under the title, "NYU Course Coordinator." Much of her initial vision is intact albeit added functionalities.
